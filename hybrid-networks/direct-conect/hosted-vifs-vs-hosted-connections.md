## DX Hosted Connections vs Hosted VIFs

-  Hosted VIFs can connect to public resources or an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) in the same way as standard VIFs. However, the account that owns the VIF is different from the connection owner. Bandwidth is shared across all VIFs on the parent connection. For instructions on creating a hosted VIF, see Create a Hosted Virtual Interface.

- Hosted connections allow an APN partner to create a DX sub-1G connection for you. Dedicated bandwidth is allocated for the DX sub-1G connection rather than having multiple VIFs on the same parent connection competing for bandwidth. Contact an APN partner to create the connection, and then complete the steps to accept a hosted connection.

- Note: You can create only one VIF per hosted DX connection.
