## Q. How can I get started with AWS Direct Connect?

Use the AWS Direct Connect tab on the AWS Management Console to create a new connection. Then you will change the region to the region you wish to use. When requesting a connection, you will be asked to select the AWS Direct Connect location you wish to use, the number of ports, and the port speed. You will also have the opportunity to request to have an AWS Direct Connect Partner contact you if you need assistance extending your office or data center network to the AWS Direct Connect location.
